# Generic Linked List
This project is an implementation of a generic linked list in C++.  
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The generic aspect of this implementation allows the linked list to store elements of any data type.  

## Features
- Supports **insertion of elements** at the front,back or any desired position of the linked list.  
- Supports **deletion of elements** from the front,back or any desired position of the linked list.  
- Supports checking if the linked list **is empty**.  
- **Get particular element** of linked list.  
- **Get size** of linked list.  
- Allows to **display elements** of linked list.

# Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.  
When contributing, please ensure that your code follows the existing code style and that you include appropriate test cases to validate your changes.  

## Usage
To use the generic linked list in your C++ project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code files.  
2. Include the `Generic_linked_list.h` header file in your C++ program: `#include "Generic_inked_list.h"`.  
3. Create an instance of the `LinkedList` class, specifying the data type of the elements you want to store. For example, to create a linked list of integers: `LinkedList<int> myList;`.  
4. Use the various member functions provided by the `LinkedList` class to manipulate the linked list as needed.
