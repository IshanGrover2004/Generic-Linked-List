# Generic Linked List
This project is an implementation of a generic linked list in C++.
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.
The generic aspect of this implementation allows the linked list to store elements of any data type.

# Features
-Supports insertion of elements at the front,back or any desired position of the linked list.
-Supports deletion of elements from the front,back or any desired position of the linked list.
-Supports checking if the linked list is empty.
-Get element of any node in linked list.
-Get size of linked list.
-Allows to print linked list.
